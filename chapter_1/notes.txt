- java class has 2 primary elements 1) methods/functions/procedures and 2) fields/variables

Classes vs Files
----------------
- Most of the time each java class is defined in its own .java file and its not required to be public i.e.:
class Animal {
	String name;
}

- You can put 2 classes into the same .java file. At most one of the classes is allowed to be public
public class Animal {
	private String name;
}
class Animal2 {
}
- in the last ex. the filename must match the public class name

Writing a main() method
-----------------------

public class Zoo {
	
	public static void main(String [] args) {
		System.out.println(" ... test ... ");
	}
}

- each file can contain just one public class
- the filename must match class name
- the public keyword is called "access modifier", declares the level of exposure to potentiall callers in the program
- the static keyword binds a method to its class so it can be called by just the class name, i.e. Zoo.main().
- the void keyword represents the return type
- the main method parameters can be writed like:
	1) String[] args;
	2) String args[];
	3) String... args;
